Ban-Peers wrote in Python, it is checking & banning BitTorrent leech peers via Web API, remove ads, working for μTorrent. The main banned are XunLei, Baidu, QQDownload, Offline download servers, other infamous leech clients, and BT players, fake clients, who reported fake progress, the fact in serious leech.

Execute checking per 10 seconds, the banned time can be specified by the start-up parameters, default is 12 hours. In some cases, temporary banned for 1 hour if the torrent is seeding. Also can temporary banned peers which refused upload 10 minutes in downloading torrents if `(AVAILABILITY - 5) * SEEDS_SWARM > 1000`. At the same time, this script will not broke the existing IP ranges (non-single IP) in ipfilter, they will be stored as-is.

[A gift](https://github.com/SeaHOH/ban-peers/issues/1) to the users of μTorrent 3 classic desktop free version, it wrote in Chinese, you can read via a translator. e.g. translate.google.com

Resist leech strongly, this is our own rights. If you feels Ban-Peers a good work, please recommend it to your friends, Thanks.

# Notices
- Does not work in old versions of μTorrent which did not provided API `getpeers`.
- **Please use this script in local network**, μTorrent Web API does not support HTTPS connections, it is not safe.
- I took preventive measures, if you stiil found a normal peer has been banned, please tell us via [issues board](https://github.com/SeaHOH/ban-peers/issues).
